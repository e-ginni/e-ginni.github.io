# Well, hello! I am Edwin Ginni

I'm a **Freelance Writer** a **Self-taught developer**(still a lot to learn) and a **Lover of eveything tech**.

## Short Bio
Can I really keep it short?

I love technology. And I love spending most of my time punching keyboard keys:- to create useful stuff.  


## Freelacnce Writing


## Programming

In my free time, I have developed a habit to browse through github repositories, seeing how people write their code, and trying to implement in my [simple projects]().

I've come to love websites and their development after decades of fantasizing their operation. I can help you build a *small* one affordably, just [reach out]().

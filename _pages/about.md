# Well, hello! I am Edwin Ginni

I'm a **Freelance Writer** a **Self-taught developer**(still a lot to learn) and a **Lover of eveything tech**.

## Short Bio
Can I really keep it short?

I love technology. And I love spending most of my time punching keyboard keys:- to create useful stuff.  


## Freelacnce Writing
One of the main reasons I tirelessly worked to get this blog up an runnig is to post content on topics I think might be useful to others.

I have always felt the need to explain technology, since there's always someone looking for something to leanrn.

I will mostly talk about Android, WordPress, Front-end web development and other topics I find interesting and helpful.

* [The Kotlin User Group in Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-User-Group-Hamburg/)

I also really enjoy public speaking and sharing my experiences. You can checkout some of my slides and videos in the [talks page](/talks). Are you looking for speakers? I'm happy to travel and come to your meetup/conference! Just send me a [mail](mailto:corti.nico@gmail.com).

## Programming

In my free time, I have developed a habit to browse through github repositories, seeing how people write their code, and trying to implement in my [simple projects]().

I've come to love websites and their development after decades of fantasizing their operation. I can help you build a *small* one affordably, just [reach out]().

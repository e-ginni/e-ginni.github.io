# Well, hello! I am Edwin Ginni

I'm a **Freelance Writer** a **Self-taught developer**(still a lot to learn) and a **Lover of eveything tech**.

## Short Bio
Can I really keep it short? 

I don't know a lot of things. One of them is giving an introduction (whether speaking or writing) about myself.

But I know how to operate a computer.

I love technology, and spending most of my time punching keyboard keys:- to create useful stuff.

See technology is the future, or at least the future for those willing to embrace it. In one way or the other, advancements in technology will impact our lives, no doubt about that. And that's why I love it.

Some  years back before I was born DVDs and 'large' mobile phones were the order of the day. But now, both music and calls can be checked out by swiping a 'watch-like' device.

I want to be part of this never-ending journey, to discover new technologies and help as many people as possible to not only use but get comfortable with them.

## Freelance Writing
In my walks around the internet, I have come to discover a lot of stuff. I've taken hours to learn some, weeks to master others while some (a lot rather) are still a puzzle to-date.

I am a natural teacher, I don't hold back to information which might be useful to the next person.
I have answered many people's questions on why some apps won't work on their devices, how some of the apps work and best alternatives to those they find 'boring' or hard to work with.

Many of those I've helped lauded my ability to simply explain how stuff works and also keep the whole process fun.

 I recently realized I can actually make a living from my desire to share information. I then decided to set up a blog to share what might be useful to a similar life form.

## Programming
In my free time, I have developed a habit to browse through github repositories, seeing how people write their code, and trying to implement in my [simple projects]().

I've come to love websites and their development after decades of fantasizing their operation. I can help you build a small one affordably, just [reach out]().

Currently, I am obsessed with the capabilities of Ruby and Javascript languages. Broad I know, but I love the journey so far.

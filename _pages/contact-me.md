## Contact form
You can reach out by filling the form below. Try to be precise for fast response.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/contact-me.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/floating-labels.css">

{% if page.url contains "/contact-me" %}
  {% include cont-form %}
{% endif %}

## E-mail
Old school? Or maybe you just don't like forms ðŸ˜ˆ

I do like mails. I infact prefer them to calls. Shoot me one at 
[edwin.ginni@gmail.com](mailto:edwin.ginni@gmail.com) and I'll be in touch.
